# SenchaCon 2011 Live Coding Sample

This is the code that I miraculously managed to put together live in my MVC Part 1 talk at Sencha Con 2011. It's a simple website-like app using Sencha Touch 2 - we just create a home page, a contact form, a blog list and a products carousel.

This was written using Sencha Touch 2 Developer Preview 1. To get it running, just download a copy of that release (http://cdn.sencha.io/touch/sencha-touch-2.0.0-pr1.zip) and drop it into this folder, making sure the unzipped Touch 2 directory is called 'touch'.
